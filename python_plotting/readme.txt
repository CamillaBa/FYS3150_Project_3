The python file included contains the plotting tools that we have used.

Each section of plots is separated by big comments, for example:

#==============================================================================
# plot solar system
#==============================================================================

By default, only only one such section is uncommented.
It is recommened to only keep one such section of the program uncommented at the time,
since we have not tested what happens when they all run simulateously.

The remaining files in the folder contain the data that the python file
needs to make plots. These can be generated using "source1.cpp" outside of this folder.





When you run the python file as is, it generates the plots for the
jupiter-earth-sun system, where the sun is kept fixed.
